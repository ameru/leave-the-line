List of back-end functions to implement:
  -GET, POST, PUT, and DEL requests by users.
  
  -API implementation of information/data that we require to make this app function. (ex. Cal Poly menu)
  
  -Database to store users' information (personal info, favorites, etc), transaction history, and other things
    that require storage.
    
  -Store Yelp-like reviews in database; learn how to store images and comments.
  
  -Real Time order status -- queue # (your place in "line" online) xD



How will we achieve this?:
  -Node.js is the environment that we program in and Express.js is the framework that will handle all the
    requests.
    
  -Learn how to implement the APIs, and how to use the data that the specific API offers. (ex. implement a
    user's get request with a response that sends the API data required).
    
-(Sullivan exclusive) Learn how to connect the database with the rest of the app and how to receive and
    send information to be stored or acquired from the database. My idea is to either use FireBase or mongoDB.
    
-Learn how to store reviews and then realtime update and upload them onto the app.

-Realtime order status might be a little tricky, will require someone to realtime update the queue by
    putting orders being made to the "in-process" queue and deleting it from the "ordered" queue. Then
    once the "in-process" is complete move it to the "ready" queue. All of this with a clock or timer of some
    sort maybe.
